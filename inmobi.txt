Q1. There are elections in town. Each candidate has been voted. A[1…n] is the array where A[i] denotes the the number of votes for the the ith candidate. 
This array A[] is sorted in descending order with ties broken by increasing indices. You can increase the votes for any candidate and also you have a desire 
list for the candidate. Rank[1…n] denotes the rank of the candidate that you want the candidate to be in that position where -1 denotes you don’t care for him. 
Find the minimum number of votes added by you to get the rank of the candidates as in Rank array. ^The question is not clear. Someone please state it properly.
Eg. A[] = {10,8,6,4,3}    
  	Rank = {0,2,1,3,-1} 
Ans 3(Increase 6 to 9)
Eg. A[] =  {100,40,15,15}
 	Rank[] = {0,1,3,2}
Ans 1 (tie breaker case).b ner
													Solution Approach..
(We need to use the greedy approach for this question. make pairs of the ranks and vote array together based on increasing ranks, and then form the back side check
for any possible changes like in first test case. after sorting arrays will be (0,10),(1,6),(2,8),(3,4), leaving negative case, now from back side condition will 
be false between 1,6 and 2,8 so i will increase 6 to 9 and done)
